# ToneTeller

ToneTeller is a sentiment analysis tool built using Python that uses NLTK and the VADER sentiment model to evaluate emotional tones within text/journaling entries. 

Designed as a tool to support mental health journaling use, this project applies polarity scoring, regex-based sentence parsing, and corpus stopword filtering to extract meaningful patterns, then visualizes sentiment trends and word frequencies through interactive charts and graphs.
